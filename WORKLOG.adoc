- create proper API; tuck inside a Ruby module *
- make dsl block for adjoining children inside delimited block
- set default attributes for article doctype *
- add option to drop role names for literals *

- make level shifting configurable (or auto-detectable?)
- implement variablelist children *
- handle preface correctly

\* convert to issues

== Test cases

* unordered / ordered list with complex content
* nested lists
* description lists
* uses double `` if literal phrase is surrounded by a word character (before, after or both)
* retrieves section title from either first child named title or title child of info
* honors sentence_per_line option
* auto-generates ids for sections
* handles id override on section
* follows xi:include elements in section content
* replaces xi:include with include macro in programlisting
