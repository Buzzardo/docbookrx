== TODO

- only use elements on listitem if first element in paragraph; otherwise, treat as inline text

- create proper API; tuck under a module
- set default attributes for article doctype
- make dsl block for adjoing children inside deliminted block
- make option to drop role names for literals
- use entity_ref?, comment?, pi? instead of comparing type to constant (mixin if necessary)
- try to set leveloffset only once
- make level shifting configurable or auto-detectable?
- variablelist children
- handle preface correctly
- table width
- table col widths
- inline formatting in table cell content
- verse blockquote
- citetitle and attribute on blockquote
- list continuation doesn't get added if literallayout is delimited
- qanda list (i.e., qandaset)
- callouts (i.e, calloutlist)
- list ids
- make char for emphasis quoting an option
- make literal paragraph indent size an option
- try to use + for literal when possible
- nested lists (currently using same level)
- cleaner solution for skipping title node
- text after variablelist inside same paragraph gets adjoined to text of last item
- make a function for detecting need for unconstrained formatting marks
- don't start output document with blank line if input document does not start with section

== Test cases

* unordered / ordered list with complex content
* nested lists
* description lists
* uses double `` if literal phrase is surrounded by a word character (before, after or both)
* retrieves section title from either first child named title or title child of info
* honors sentence_per_line option
* auto-generates ids for sections
* handles id override on section
* follows xi:include elements in section content
* replaces xi:include with include macro in programlisting
